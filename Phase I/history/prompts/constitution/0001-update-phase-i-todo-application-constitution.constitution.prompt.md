## Prompt

# Project: Evolution of Todo — Phase I
## In-Memory Console-Based Todo Application

---

## Mission

Build an in-memory, console-based Todo application in Python using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**, with all code generated exclusively through **Claude Code via Spec-Kit Plus**.

---

## Authority

This constitution is the highest authority.
If any spec, plan, task, or implementation conflicts with it, the constitution must be followed.

---

## Core Principles

- **Spec-Driven Development First**
  Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation
  No code without an approved spec.

- **Zero Manual Coding**
  All code must be generated by Claude Code. Manual edits are forbidden.

- **Simplicity Before Scale**
  Focus on correctness, clarity, and extensibility—not persistence or UI polish.

- **Deterministic Behavior**
  Same input must always produce the same output.

---

## Phase I Scope

### Included
- In-memory storage only
- Python console I/O
- Single-user usage
- Clear separation of logic and UI
- Modular, testable design

### Excluded
- File I/O or databases
- APIs, web UI, or networking
- AI / LLM integrations
- Authentication
- Background processes
- Cloud or container tooling

---

## Technical Standards

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Data Model:** Plain Python objects (dataclasses preferred)
- **Dependencies:** Standard library only
- **Error Handling:** Clear, human-readable messages
- **Input Validation:** Required for all user input

---

## Specification Rules

- Each feature spec must define:
  - Intent
  - Inputs
  - Outputs
  - Edge cases
  - Failure conditions

- Specs must be Markdown, deterministic, and implementation-agnostic.
- Specs may be refined until Claude Code produces correct behavior.

---

## Quality Bar

- No unused or dead code
- No speculative abstractions
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - Task model
  - Business logic
  - Console interaction

---

## Evolution Constraints

Phase I decisions must not block:
- Phase II (FastAPI + SQLModel)
- Phase III (AI agent control)
- Phase IV (Containerization)

---

## Success Criteria

Phase I is complete when:
- All features work fully in memory
- No manual code edits were made
- Output matches approved specs exactly
- Code is clean, modular, and extensible

## Response snapshot

I've updated the constitution for Phase I (In-Memory Todo CLI) and synchronized the Plan template to reflect the strict technical constraints (Python 3.11+, Standard Library only, In-memory).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High - Established governance for Phase I implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution and plan template.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Use /sp.specify to define initial features.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user provided a very clear set of rules which were mapped directly into the constitution template.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
