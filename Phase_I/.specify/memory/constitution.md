# Evolution of Todo — Phase I Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development First
Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation. No code must be written or modified
without an approved specification and implementation plan. This ensures all changes are intentional
and documented.

### II. Zero Manual Coding
All code must be generated by Claude Code via Spec-Kit Plus. Manual edits to any source file are
strictly forbidden to maintain the integrity of the generative workflow and ensure traceability.

### III. Simplicity Before Scale
Focus on correctness, clarity, and extensibility. Do not implement persistence, complex UIs, or
over-engineered abstractions in Phase I. Solve the immediate problem with the simplest viable solution.

### IV. Deterministic Behavior
The application must produce consistent, predictable outputs for the same inputs. Avoid non-deterministic
logic unless explicitly required by the specification (e.g., UUID generation).

### V. Separation of Concerns
Maintain a strict boundary between the Task model, Business Logic, and Console Interactive UI.
Each module should be independently testable and maintainable.

### VI. Evolution Constraints
Phase I decisions must not block future evolution. Specifically, the data model and logic should be
designed to easily transition to FastAPI + SQLModel in Phase II and AI agent control in Phase III.

## Phase I Scope

### Included
- In-memory storage only (no database)
- Python console I/O (interactive CLI)
- Single-user usage
- Modular, testable design using dataclasses

### Excluded
- Persistence (File I/O or databases)
- Network APIs or Web UI
- AI / LLM native integrations (Phase III)
- Authentication/Authorization
- Background processes or async workers

## Technical Standards
- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **Data Model**: Plain Python objects (dataclasses)
- **Dependencies**: Python Standard Library only
- **Error Handling**: Human-readable messages with clear failure states
- **Input Validation**: Required for all user-provided data

## Specification Rules
- Each feature spec must define: Intent, Inputs, Outputs, Edge cases, and Failure conditions.
- Specs must be Markdown-based and implementation-agnostic.
- Specs are the source of truth; implementations must match them exactly.

## Quality Bar
- No unused or dead code; delete what is not needed.
- No speculative abstractions; implement only what is required by the spec.
- Code must be clean, modular, and pass all defined acceptance criteria.

## Governance
- This constitution is the highest authority; all other artifacts must align with it.
- Amendments require a version bump and updated Sync Impact Report.
- Every tool call and user prompt must be recorded in a PHR for traceability.

**Version**: 1.2.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-01 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-02
