## Prompt

"Project: Full-Stack Todo Evolution (Phase 2)

Core Principles:
- Multi-Tier Isolation: Phase 2 code must reside strictly in `/phase-2-web/frontend` and `/phase-2-web/backend`.
- Persistence: Replace in-memory logic with Neon PostgreSQL using SQLModel.
- Secure by Design: Every API request must be validated via Better Auth JWT tokens.
- Zero Manual Coding: All code in the phase-2 folder must be generated by Claude Code.

Key Standards:
- Backend: Python 3.13+, FastAPI, SQLModel.
- Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS.
- Communication: REST API with JSON payloads.
- Auth: Shared Secret JWT verification between Next.js and FastAPI."

## Response snapshot

Created Phase 2 Constitution v1.0.0 with six core principles:
1. Multi-Tier Isolation - Code boundary enforcement for frontend/backend separation
2. Persistence First - Neon PostgreSQL + SQLModel mandate
3. Secure by Design - Better Auth JWT validation requirement
4. Zero Manual Coding - AI-generation provenance enforcement
5. Test-First Discipline - TDD guidelines
6. API Contract Enforcement - REST/JSON communication standards

Added Technology Standards, Development Workflow, and Governance sections. All dependent templates verified as already aligned.

## Outcome

- Impact: Established foundational governance for Phase 2 full-stack development
- Tests: N/A (constitution document)
- Files: 1 modified (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- Next prompts: `/sp.specify` to create first feature spec, consider `/sp.adr` for tech stack decisions
- Reflection: Initial constitution captures all user-provided principles with enforcement details

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor constitution compliance during first feature implementation
